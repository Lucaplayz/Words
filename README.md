if the HTML does not automatically open download it then open the HTML and enjoy the game

if you don't want to download it just copy the code put it into Notepad (or whatever other text editor you have) and just paste the code into your text editor save it as then name it words.html then you should be able to play!

I will update this it is a work in progress
